I think that the love of reading is slowly being lost with the ever-increasing demand for cheap and instant dopamine (and there is some merit to this - post for another day). While the world does not need another blog, I figured it might be somewhat worthwhile to reciprocate some small nuggets of wisdom that I have resonated with, and share a bit more about my life.

It brings me great joy when I'm stalking someone's LinkedIn and they have a blog to read; I feel as if it allows me to connect much more deeply with that person than I would have been able to otherwise. I guess that's all blog posts really are; a small glimpse into someone's thoughts at a point in time.
