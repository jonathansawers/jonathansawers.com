      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>My passion for technology began playing Tonka Raceway on our Windows 95 family PC with a whiny CRT. My primary school ran a Scratch programming class, which led to me spending weekends developing (very mediocre) games with a few other keen peers. When Minecraft took over the mainstream a few years later, I started learning CraftBukkit Java plugins to run servers for my mates – which later turned into a short freelancing career working with a large education company in Abu Dhabi, and a childhood idol of mine, Preston Plays.</p>
      <p>Throughout the latter years of high school and my late teens, I got a taste of network engineering and technical support. Working with the public and private sector, I assisted on network infrastructure rollouts and general IT help callouts for a wide range of clients, further expanding my experience and love for technology. I'm now exploring opportunities in the high-frequency and quantitative trading space.</p>
